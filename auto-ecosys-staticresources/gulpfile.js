In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs = Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go = Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar = The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mack = In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my e = esThere beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile =  back
